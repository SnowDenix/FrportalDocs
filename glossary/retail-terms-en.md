## Inventory Management Terms

### Stock Cover (Stock-to-Sales Ratio)

**Definition:** The ratio of current stock to the last 7 days of sales, indicating how many weeks of inventory are on hand.

**Formula:**
```
Stock Cover = Current Stock Units / 7-Day Sales Units
```

**Example Scenario:** A store has 140 polo shirts and sold 20 units in the last 7 days:
- Stock Cover = 140 / 20 = 7 weeks of stock

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** High stock cover indicates excess inventory and tied-up capital. Low values signal stockout risk.

---

### Stock Turnover Rate

**Definition:** A calculation tool that measures how quickly a store sells through its inventory within a specific period.

**Formula:**
```
Stock Turnover Rate = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value
```

**Example Scenario:** Annual COGS of $100,000 and average inventory of $20,000:
- Stock Turnover = 100,000 / 20,000 = 5 times/year

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** Higher turnover indicates healthy inventory management and better cash flow.

---

### Stock Keeping Unit (SKU)

**Definition:** The smallest unit of a product option planned for production. Each SKU represents a unique product variant.

**Example Scenario:** U.S. Polo Assn. men's polo shirt, blue color, size M = 1 SKU

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** Proper SKU management ensures inventory accuracy and sales tracking.

---

### Sell-Through Rate (STR)

**Definition:** A measurement tool that calculates what percentage of the planned or produced quantity has been sold since the start of the season.

**Formula:**
```
STR = (Units Sold / Units Produced or Planned) × 100
```

**Example Scenario:** If 7,500 units sold out of 10,000 produced:
- STR = (7,500 / 10,000) × 100 = 75%

---

### Shelf Life

**Definition:** The total number of days a product option or size has been on the sales floor with stock greater than zero.

**Example Scenario:** A product stayed on shelf for 45 days with sales activity = 45 days shelf life

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** Long shelf life indicates slow-moving stock and potential markdown requirement.

---

### Product Blocking

**Definition:** The process of stopping the sale of certain products in some or all stores for various reasons. Blocked products are added to a restricted list to prevent accidental reservations.

**Rule:** When a product is returned or transferred from a store, it is added to that store's blocked list. **The sending store cannot be the receiving store.**

**Example Scenario:** Product transferred from Istanbul to Ankara store is added to Istanbul's blocked list.
