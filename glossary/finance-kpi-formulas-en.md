## Profitability KPIs

### EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)

**Definition:** Operating profit before interest and tax expenses are deducted.

**Formula:**
```
EBIT = Sales Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Operating Expenses
```

or

```
EBIT = Net Income + Interest Expense + Tax Expense
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Sales Revenue: $1,000,000
- COGS: $500,000
- Operating Expenses: $250,000
- **EBIT = 1,000,000 - 500,000 - 250,000 = $250,000**

**Use Case:** Measures operational efficiency independent of financing structure.

---

### EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)

**Definition:** Shows cash generation capacity before non-cash expenses.

**Formula:**
```
EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization
```

**Example Calculation:**
- EBIT: $250,000
- Depreciation: $30,000
- Amortization: $5,000
- **EBITDA = 250,000 + 30,000 + 5,000 = $285,000**

---

### Gross Margin %

**Definition:** Shows what percentage of sales remains as gross profit.

```

**Example Calculation:**
- Sales Revenue: $100,000
- COGS: $40,000
- **Gross Margin % = ((100,000 - 40,000) / 100,000) × 100 = 60%**

- **Net Profit Margin = (50,000 / 500,000) × 100 = 10%**

---

### Markup

**Definition:** The ratio of selling price to cost price.

**Formula:**
```

```

**Example Calculation:**
- Cost: $100
- Retail Price: $350
- **Markup = 350 / 100 = 3.5×**
- **Markup % = ((350 - 100) / 100) × 100 = 250%**

---

### ROS (Return on Sales)

**Formula:**
```
ROS = (Operating Income / Net Sales) × 100
```

```

**Example Calculation:**
- Beginning Inventory: 500 units
- Period Receipts: 1,500 units
- Units Sold: 1,600 units
- **Sell-Through = (1,600 / (500 + 1,500)) × 100 = 80%**

```

**Example Calculation:**
- This Year (same stores): $1,200,000
- Last Year (same stores): $1,000,000
