```
Loyalty Penetration % = (Member Sales Count / Total Sales Count) × 100
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Total sales count: 1,000
- Member sales count: 720
- Loyalty Penetration = (720 / 1,000) × 100 = **72%**

**Target:** 70% and above

**Franchise Impact:** High penetration = more customer data = better targeting

---

#### Customer Match Rate

```

**Example Calculation:**
- Total members: 50,000
- Purchased in last 12 months: 20,000

**Franchise Impact:** Active customer rate shows loyalty program effectiveness

---

#### New Customer Acquisition

---

#### Customer Retention Rate

**Definition:** Rate of customers who purchased in previous period purchasing again in current period

**Formula:**
```
Retention Rate % = ((Period End Active - New Acquired) / Period Start Active) × 100
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Period start active: 10,000
- Period end active: 11,000
- New acquired: 3,000
- Retention = ((11,000 - 3,000) / 10,000) × 100 = **80%**

**Target:** 70% and above

---

### 3. Customer Value KPIs

#### Average Transaction Value (ATV)

**Definition:** Average basket value

**Formula:**
```
ATV = Total Sales Amount / Total Transaction Count

**Target:** 2.0 and above

---

#### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

**Definition:** Estimated lifetime revenue from a customer

**Formula:**
```
CLV = Average Order Value × Annual Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan (years)
