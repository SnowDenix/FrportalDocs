(Approaches again after 3 minutes)
Staff: "How's it going? Are you looking for something specific or just browsing?"
```

**🎯 Coaching Note:**
- Eye contact and genuine smile in the first 10 seconds is critical

perfectly matches this shirt's color. Same brand, similar fabric quality. 
Would you like to have a look without trying?"

```

**🎯 Coaching Note:**

#### Scenario 3.2: Upsell

**Situation:** Customer has selected a basic t-shirt, seems to have budget.

**✅ Correct Approach:**
```
Staff: "This t-shirt is a nice choice. However, I'd like to show you our premium series."
Customer: "What's the difference?"
Staff: "This is organic cotton, softer and longer-lasting. 
It doesn't lose shape even after 10 washes. The price difference is only 150 TL 
but quality-wise it's a much higher segment."
Customer: "How much is it?"
Staff: "This is 799 TL, the other is 649 TL. But if you think of it as an investment, 
this product can be worn much longer."
```

**🎯 Coaching Note:**
- Explain upsell through value
- Say "higher quality" instead of "more expensive"
- Minimize price difference: "Only X TL difference"
- Emphasize long-term benefit

#### Scenario 3.3: Closing the Sale

**Situation:** Customer tried the product, liked it but seems undecided.

**✅ Correct Approach:**

Customer: "I liked it but let me think a bit."
Staff: "Of course. Let me mention, only 2 pieces in size M are left of this model 
and new shipment comes in 3 weeks. Would you like me to set it aside?"
Customer: "Hmm, okay I'll take it then."
Staff: "Super! Let's go to the register. By the way, we have 3-month installment on credit card."
```

**🎯 Coaching Note:**

### SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING SCENARIOS

---

#### Scenario 4.1: "Too Expensive" Objection

**Situation:** Customer liked the product but finds the price high.

**❌ Wrong Approach:**
```
Staff: "Prices are set by headquarters, there's nothing I can do."
```

**✅ Correct Approach:**
```
Customer: "Nice but too expensive."
Staff: "I understand, budget is important. But let me say this: This shirt is 
100% Egyptian cotton, made in Turkey, and has non-iron fabric technology. 
Similar quality products are sold at 2x the price in the market."
Customer: "Still..."
Staff: "Let me offer you an alternative. The previous season version of this model 
is 30% off. Almost the same, just different color options. Would you like to look?"
```

**🎯 Coaching Note:**
- Defend price with value
- Emphasize quality, durability, brand guarantee
- Offer alternative product (discounted, different model)

**✅ Correct Approach:**
```
Customer: "A similar shirt at X store was 500 TL."

However, comparing product quality is also important. 
Our product is [brand], fabric quality and stitching are different. 
Also, our exchange and return policy is very flexible – hassle-free exchange within 30 days."
Customer: "But still..."
Staff: "Let me suggest this: Try this product, feel the fabric. 
If you compare it with the other product and still think that one is better, 
you can always exchange it."
```

**🎯 Coaching Note:**
- Don't badmouth competitors, praise your own product
- Explain quality difference concretely
- Provide try-and-return assurance
- Respect the customer's decision

---

#### Scenario 4.3: "I Need to Think About It" Objection

**Situation:** Customer says they can't decide.

**✅ Correct Approach:**
```
Customer: "I need to think about it, maybe I'll come tomorrow."
Staff: "Of course, no rush. But I'm curious – 
what exactly will you think about? Maybe I can help."
Customer: "I'm not sure about the color."
Staff: "I see! Let's put both colors side by side. Which one fits your wardrobe better?"
(Or)
Staff: "If you'd like, I can set aside both colors, when you come tomorrow 
you can try both and decide."
```

**🎯 Coaching Note:**
- "What will you think about?" reveals the real objection
- Usually there's hesitation about price, size, or color
- Product reservation creates commitment
- Don't pressure, be understanding

I'll also report this to our quality team."
Customer: "I couldn't find the receipt."
Staff: "No problem, if you paid by credit card we can find it in the system.
