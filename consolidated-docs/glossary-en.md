#### Stock Turnover Rate

**Definition:** A calculation tool that measures how quickly a store sells through its inventory within a specific period.

**Formula:**
```
Stock Turnover Rate = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value
```

**Example Scenario:** Annual COGS of $100,000 and average inventory of $20,000:
- Stock Turnover = 100,000 / 20,000 = 5 times/year

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** Higher turnover indicates healthy inventory management and better cash flow.


#### Sell-Through Rate (STR)

**Definition:** A measurement tool that calculates what percentage of the planned or produced quantity has been sold since the start of the season.

**Formula:**
```
STR = (Units Sold / Units Produced or Planned) × 100
```

**Example Scenario:** If 7,500 units sold out of 10,000 produced:
- STR = (7,500 / 10,000) × 100 = 75%


#### Product Blocking

**Definition:** The process of stopping the sale of certain products in some or all stores for various reasons. Blocked products are added to a restricted list to prevent accidental reservations.

**Rule:** When a product is returned or transferred from a store, it is added to that store's blocked list. **The sending store cannot be the receiving store.**

**Example Scenario:** Product transferred from Istanbul to Ankara store is added to Istanbul's blocked list.


#### Assortment Life Cycle – Multiplier

**Definition:** The scaling of a stock option's sales potential across time for each classification.

**Example Scenario:** Summer polo shirts have peak sales potential June-August, low in October.


#### Size Break

**Definition:** The absence of planned or produced sizes in store inventory.

**Example Scenario:** Size M is sold out, only XS and XXL remain = Size Break

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** Size breaks directly cause lost sales.


#### Top-Bottom Ratio

**Definition:** The ratio of total tops inventory to total bottoms inventory. Used to monitor display balance.

**Formula:**
```
Top-Bottom Ratio = Total Tops Stock / Total Bottoms Stock
```

**Example Scenario:** 1,000 tops, 600 bottoms = 1,000/600 = 1.67 ratio


#### Carryover Stock

**Definition:** Inventory that was planned to or actually carries over to the next season due to unsold quantities.

**Example Scenario:** Unsold items from Summer 2025 transferred to Summer 2026

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** Carryover stock negatively affects cash flow and usually requires discounted sales.


#### Physical Stock vs. Final Stock

**Physical Stock:** Products with accepted delivery notes that are in store inventory and available for immediate sale.

**Final Stock:** Physical stock plus pending delivery notes minus pending transfers and returns.

**Formula:**
```
Final Stock = Physical Stock + Pending Deliveries - Pending Transfers - Pending Returns
```


#### Transfer-Return

**Definition:** The process of moving a product from a low-selling store to a higher-selling store.

**Objectives:**
- Increase product sales
- Utilize store capacity effectively
- Correct store stock mix

- Reduce overstocking in high-inventory stores


#### Sales and Performance Terms

#### Like-for-Like (LFL)

**Definition:** A measurement method for comparing performance between the same stores across equivalent time periods.

**Formula:**
```
LFL % = ((Current Period Sales - Prior Period Sales) / Prior Period Sales) × 100
```

**Example Scenario:** November 2025 vs November 2024, same 50 stores sales comparison

**Stock/Cash-Flow Impact:** Measures true growth by excluding new store effects.


#### Markup

**Definition:** The multiplier indicating how many times the product's cash price (PSF) is above the purchase cost (COGS).

**Formula:**

Markup = Retail Price / Purchase Cost
```

**Example Scenario:** Product with $100 cost sold at $350:
- Markup = 350 / 100 = 3.5×


#### OTB (Open To Buy)

**Definition:** The remaining quantity calculated by subtracting the already produced amount from the planned production quantity.

**Formula:**
```
OTB = Planned Production Quantity - Actual Production Quantity
```


#### Size Assortment

**Definition:** The distribution of units per size within a pack for each option.

**Example Scenario:**
| Size | XS | S | M | L | XL | Total |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|-------|
