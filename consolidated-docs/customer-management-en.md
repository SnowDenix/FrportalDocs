| ✅ Search existing customer before registration | ❌ Don't directly create new record |
| ✅ Leave empty instead of fake info | ❌ Don't accept aaa@aaa.com |
| ✅ Report suspected duplicates | ❌ Don't ignore |

### Data Quality Checklist

**At Every Customer Registration:**

- [ ] Is first/last name in correct format?
- [ ] Is customer not already registered?
- [ ] Were GDPR consents obtained?

### Customer Approach

**To get correct information:**
> "We'll have a special surprise for you on your birthday, so it's important for me to get your date of birth correctly."

> "I need to record your email address correctly so we can inform you about campaigns. Can you spell it out?"

**If they don't want to provide:**
> "Of course, that's entirely your choice. I'll leave that field empty."

## KPIs

### Ticket Performance KPIs

| KPI | Definition | Formula | Target |
|-----|------------|---------|--------|
| **First Contact Resolution (FCR)** | Percentage of tickets resolved on first contact | (Resolved on First Contact / Total Tickets) × 100 | >60% |
| **SLA Compliance** | Percentage of tickets closed within SLA | (Closed Within SLA / Total Closed) × 100 | >95% |
| **Average Resolution Time** | Average time to resolution | Total Resolution Time / Closed Tickets | <36 hours |
| **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)** | Customer satisfaction score | Satisfied Customers / Survey Responses × 100 | >85% |
| **Reopened Ticket Rate** | Percentage of reopened tickets | (Reopened / Total Closed) × 100 | <5% |
| **Ticket per Transaction** | Ticket rate per transaction | Total Tickets / Total Sales × 1000 | <2‰ |

### Calculation Examples

**FCR Calculation:**
```
Tickets resolved on first contact: 150
Total tickets: 250
FCR = (150 / 250) × 100 = 60%
```

**SLA Compliance Calculation:**
```
Closed within SLA: 190
Total closed: 200
SLA Compliance = (190 / 200) × 100 = 95%
```
