## KPIs

### Marketing Performance KPIs

| KPI | Formula | Target | Frequency |
|-----|---------|--------|-----------|
| **ROMI** | (Revenue - Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost | 3:1 | Per Campaign |
| **Cost Per Acquisition** | Total Marketing Cost / New Customers | < $25 | Monthly |
| **Brand Awareness** | Aided Recall % | > 60% | Quarterly |
| **Social Engagement Rate** | (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Followers × 100 | > 3% | Weekly |
| **Email Open Rate** | Opens / Delivered × 100 | > 25% | Per Campaign |

Example:
- Campaign Revenue: $150,000
- Campaign Cost: $40,000
- ROI = (($150,000 - $40,000) / $40,000) × 100 = 275%
