## Store Tips

### For Fast and Accurate Registration

1. **Verify phone number:** Send a test SMS to customer's mobile
2. **Check email letter by letter:** Most common error field
3. **Always get date of birth:** Critical for birthday campaigns
4. **Explain permissions:** Tell customer the advantages, don't force

### Sales-Boosting Tactics

1. **Review past purchases:** "We have a tie that matches the shirt you bought last month"
2. **Remind points balance:** "You have X points, would you like to use them today?"
3. **Announce upcoming campaigns:** "There's an exclusive 20% discount for members next week"
4. **Celebrate birthdays:** If the system alerts, congratulate the customer

### For Data Quality

1. **Match at every sale:** Matching rate affects your KPI
2. **Correct what you see wrong:** Request update if there's an error in profile
3. **Report duplicates:** Report if the same customer comes with different profiles

### For Difficult Situations

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Customer doesn't want to register | Only make anonymous sale, don't force |
| Customer doesn't want to provide info | Register with minimum required fields |
| Customer is complaining | Open a ticket, be understanding |
| System crashed | Issue manual receipt, enter into system later |
