### Segmentation KPIs

| KPI | Definition | Formula | Target |
|-----|------------|---------|--------|
| **Champion Rate** | Champion customer ratio | Champions / Total × 100 | >10% |
| **At Risk Rate** | At risk customer ratio | At Risk / Total × 100 | <10% |

### Calculation Examples

**Churn Rate:**
```
Period start active customers: 10,000
Period end lost: 1,200
Churn Rate = (1,200 / 10,000) × 100 = 12%
```

**Winback Rate:**
```
Lost customers: 2,000
Recovered: 150
Winback Rate = (150 / 2,000) × 100 = 7.5%
