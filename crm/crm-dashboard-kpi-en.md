Loyalty Penetration % = (Member Sales Count / Total Sales Count) × 100
```

**Example Calculation:**

- Member sales count: 720
- Loyalty Penetration = (720 / 1,000) × 100 = **72%**

**Target:** 70% and above

**Franchise Impact:** High penetration = more customer data = better targeting

---
